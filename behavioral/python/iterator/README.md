# Use Case

Suppose you have a list of words (or "_collection_" of words). We can "_iterate_" that list in multiple ways, but the simplest one is one element at a time, starting from the 1st one and ending with the last element in that list.

Implement the iterator design pattern, in such a way that we can create a "_collection_" of words which can be "_iterated_" just as we would do it with a `for` loop, but now using a "_concrete iterator_" class.
